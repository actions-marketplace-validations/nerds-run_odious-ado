# Running the service
The [CLI](../cli/index) has a build-in commands to help bootstrap and start the service.

Before being able to run the service with the cli we must first start its dependencies and configure them. This requires
docker compose to be run. The docker compose file can be found here: `infrastructure/images/docker-compose.yaml`. There
are some additional services can be removed if not interested in using them.

```{note}
:class: note

This should all be running in k8s locally.  Update me please!
```

```shell
docker compose  --project-directory ./infrastructure/images up
```

[CLI](../cli/index).


```shell
# add --reload=true to auto reload local server when savings files. 
poetry run incidents start
```

This will start the service along with a watchdog process looking for changes. In addition, the service has two
documentation endpoints and a status endpoint for health checks. Both redoc and open api provide the same functionality
they just have a different look and feel. After the service is running verify that it has some data in the service get
http request using one of the documentation tools linked below.

The response should look like the following.
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "environments": [
        "performance-dev"
      ],
      "service_id": "2f31fd25-1eac-40f2-8a2a-72f24c0de567",
      "service_name": "mongodb",
      "service_description": "MongoDB its web scale!",
      "tags": [
        "dev",
        "performance",
        "aws"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "limit": 25,
    "offset": 0,
    "response_time": 0.000007,
    "status_code": 200,
    "total_results": 0
  },
  "notifications": {
    "info": [],

    "error": []
  }
}
```
